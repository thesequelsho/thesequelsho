- 👋 Hi, I’m @thesequelsho
- 👀 I’m interested in the RED team and developing my skills to be very proficient. Also, would love to develop a deep understanding of computer forensics and what it takes to be an expert in this area. Lastly, I am interested in energy and how it will be stored and protected in the future.  
- 🌱 I have passed my Security+ (April 2022) and Network+ (March 2023)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a new porject that I can sharpen my skills.
